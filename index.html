  <h1>Good Morning! Take a look at my portfolio!</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an undergraudate student at Saint Xavier University. I major in computer science. I also atteneded DeVry University Advantage Academy, where I earned an associates degree in business administration while I obtained my high school diploma. I'm all about working as fast as possible, and I also enjoy learning new things so I can continue to adapt. It's for this reason that I really like cybersecurity. I was born and raised in Chicago. I love getting the chance to meet new people and make new experinces, so I hope you never feel too shy to say hello. I personally love taking winter walks, as it is my favorite season. I also exclusively wear converse shoes, a fact many around me have picked up on.</p>
