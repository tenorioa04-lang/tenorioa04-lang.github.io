  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am an undergraudate student at Saint Xavier University. I major in computer science. I also atteneded DeVry University Advantage Academy, where I earned an associates degree in business administration while I obtained my high school diploma. I'm all about working as fast as possible, and I also enjoy learning new things so I can continue to adapt. It's for this reason that I really like cybersecurity.</p>
